# Yelp Data Science
This is my first data science/machine learning repository.


## The Data
This is the data from the Yelp academic dataset. In the interest of preserving the licensing of 
the data and images provided, the raw dataset is not accessible through this repository.

Information on and access to the Yelp dataset is available [here](https://www.yelp.com/dataset). 
Please  download a copy of the data set and the photos directory (if desired, code will function 
without the images present, but will lack extra visualization) to rebuild and modify the notebooks
present in this directory.

The data set is expected to be provided in the following data structure:

####/dataset/data/
The raw dataset downloaded in the `dataset.tgz` file.

####/dataset/photos/
The raw photos dataset downloaded in the `photos.tgz` file.
